CORS controls who can access your server from a different domain.
You define a policy in your Startup.cs file to specify allowed origins, methods, and headers.
You apply this policy to your application so it knows to enforce these rules.
By setting up CORS, you ensure your server only allows requests from trusted sources, enhancing security.
